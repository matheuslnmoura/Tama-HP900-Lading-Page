                <p>Two Decades. Now One Step Beyond.</p>
                <p>The Iron Cobra achieved its legendary status because of its ability to strongly support both the artistic and logistical requirements associated with the art of drumming. Since its inception…smooth, effortless performance and unparalleled response have been hallmarks of the Iron Cobra.</p>
                <p>In its efforts to expand the boundaries of this original design, TAMA has continued to work at improving the Iron Cobra, always with an eye towards bringing drummers closer to their own creative objectives. Now, through meticulous analysis of the Cobra</p>

With 40% less weight than our previous sprocket, the new Iron Cobra offers faster, smoother, more powerful performance than ever before.</p>

                    <p>Until now, the only way to adjust your beater stroke action was to tighten the pedal spring. The unfortunate result? Heavy, sluggish action. The Cobra Coil solves the problem by adding a steel return spring. The return spring constantly presses the footboard to its original position, tightening the relationship between foot and pedal. Even better, the Cobra Coil is adjustable to different positions on the Iron Cobra footboard base plate.</p>

                    <h2>Power-Strike Cobra Beater</h2>
                    <p>The constant evolution of Iron Cobra has always been driven, in part, by TAMA's passion for sound?or more precisely, TAMA's passion to bring the best out of each and every bass drum on which Iron Cobra is played. The latest version of Iron Cobra features a smaller diameter but thicker beater head?a combination that delivers more attack than previous designs. Also the distance between the beater head's face and the shaft has been increased. Drummers found this alteration improved their sense of control during faster passages.</p>

                    <h2>Swivel Spring Tight (US.PAT.NO.9236038)</h2>
                    <p>The conventional approach to the spring assembly has been to anchor the bottom of the spring while the top of the spring is being pulled from various angles throughout the pedal's cycle. But a spring being pulled on at an angle represents wasted energy and causes turbulence. The Swivel Spring Tight assembly solves this problem, recapturing that lost energy and optimizing smoothness through the use of a contoured assembly that allows the base to swivel freely with the spring. This enables a straight spring pull during the pedal's entire cycle, resulting in the smoothest, lightest action ever found on a bass drum pedal.</p>

                    <p>TAMA now introduces Para-Clamp II -an even more clever and useful version of the popular original. The Para-Clamp II is capable of gripping the widest variety of bass drum hoops ever. The improvement is largely due to its newly designed three-dimensional rubber grip. Holding power is increased and the possibility of scratching the hoop is eliminated. Furthermore, set-up and breakdown are easily facilitated, while sitting on a throne because the T-bolt of the Para-Clamp II Pro is on the side of the footboard, rather than under it.</p>
